# Portfolio

*Welcome*!

This repository serves as a summary of the open source projects I'm associated with, both current and past, as instigator or contributor.

## Instigator

### [robotframework-kicadlibrary](https://github.com/madworx/robotframework-kicadlibrary)

[Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) [library](https://robotframework.org/#libraries) to do verification of [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) designs.

It comes with 100% code-coverage, automated builds, verifications and packaging.

Full Keyword documentation (always up-to-date) is available [at this link](https://madworx.github.io/robotframework-kicadlibrary/KiCadLibrary.html).

### [docker-netbsd](https://github.com/madworx/docker-netbsd)

Docker image enabling you to run the [NetBSD operating system](https://www.netbsd.org/) inside a docker image, running on a Linux Docker engine.

If your host system supports it, and you run the container with the `--privileged` option, you gain access to full KVM virtualization, enabling you to run the NetBSD operating system at near full-speed.

### [raspi-ic-tester](https://github.com/madworx/raspi-ic-tester)

Raspberry PI-based tester for DIL/DIP integrated circuits.

This was created as a support tool for a larger project not yet published.

### [docker-minix](https://github.com/madworx/docker-minix)

Docker image enabling you to run the [MINIX3 operating system](https://www.minix3.org/) inside a docker image, running on a Linux Docker engine.

If your host system supports it, and you run the container with the `--privileged` option, you gain access to full KVM virtualization, enabling you to run MINIX3 at near full-speed.

### [docshell](https://github.com/madworx/docshell)

A minimalistic approach to solving the problem of keeping shell scripts up-to-date with documentation and `--help` output.

### [cd-ci-glue](https://github.com/madworx/cd-ci-glue)

Small collection of shell-script functions to interact with Travis CI, Docker Hub and Github pages/wikis.

### [maven-github-releases](https://github.com/madworx/maven-github-releases)

Using your local Apache web server to act as a Maven repository.
